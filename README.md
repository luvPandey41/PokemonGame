This is a 2D Pokemon Inspired RPG Game built using elementary tools such as the Eclipse IDE, the tile editor Tiled, the online sprite library theSpritersResource.com, the PNG manipulation site Piskel.com, and the online pokemon data possesing API PokeAPI. 
The project explores game development fundamentals such as tile mapping, collision detection, player movement, sprite animation, and battle handling. 
The project applies polymorphism in a large scale, modular manner, allowing for flexible changes and addition to the game without rewriting core logic. 
The project was initially shared through google drive, and was only uploaded on this site at a time where it is near complete. Early changes are not logged on this platform.
